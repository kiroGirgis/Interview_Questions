This repository is dedicated to helping individuals prepare for data analytics interviews
by providing detailed answers to common and advanced interview questions.

The repository includes a variety of topics within data analytics, such as SQL, data manipulation, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA),
statistical analysis, and data visualization. 

The goal is to provide not only the solutions to these interview questions but also clear explanations, code samples, and insights
to assist anyone looking to strengthen their data analytics knowledge.

The repository covers a range of questions, starting from basic SQL queries and progressing to more complex topics, including machine learning fundamentals and business intelligence tools like Power BI and Tableau.
You'll find solutions written in SQL, Python, R, and even Excel,along with explanations and best practices to approach each problem. 

The content is structured to ensure that readers can follow along with ease, whether they are beginners or have prior experience in data analytics.
It’s an invaluable resource for those preparing for interviews or anyone wanting to sharpen their analytical skills.

The project is organized into directories by topic, including folders for SQL, Python, and R.
Each folder contains files with detailed solutions to individual questions,
as well as explanations and relevant code. 
The SQL folder includes questions related to database queries and manipulations,
while the Python folder provides solutions using libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization.

If you prefer R for statistical analysis, you’ll also find an R folder with solutions in that language.
Feel free to use the code and insights to help with your own preparation, and don’t hesitate to contribute by submitting issues, suggestions,
