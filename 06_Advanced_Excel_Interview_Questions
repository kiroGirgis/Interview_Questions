Purpose: Welcome to this section of my portfolio! Here, you will find a curated collection of Excel interview questions
that I have thoughtfully answered. 
Each solution is accompanied by detailed comments and explanations to ensure clarity and to demonstrate my thought
process.

The goal of this repository is not only to showcase my proficiency in Excel but also to serve as a resource for others 
preparing for interviews or
looking to strengthen their understanding of Excel concepts.
The questions cover a range of topics, from foundational queries to more advanced techniques, highlighting practical 
applications
and best practices in database management and analysis.

Feel free to explore, learn, and reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss these examples further.
Let's grow together in mastering the art of data querying!

4- Use a criteria range to apply complex filters.

-- What is a scenario where you would use Excel Goal Seek, solver, or what-if Analysis tools?

ANSWER:
Goal Seek: Use when you know the desired result and need to find the input value.
Example: To find the required interest rate for a loan payment of $500.
Solver: Use for complex optimization problems with constraints.
Example: Maximize profits by adjusting production levels.
What-If Analysis: Use to analyze scenarios based on different inputs.
Example: Create a Scenario Summary for high, medium, and low sales estimates.
