Purpose: Welcome to this section of my portfolio! Here, you will find a curated collection of Excel interview questions
that I have thoughtfully answered. 
Each solution is accompanied by detailed comments and explanations to ensure clarity and to demonstrate my thought
process.

The goal of this repository is not only to showcase my proficiency in Excel but also to serve as a resource for others 
preparing for interviews or
looking to strengthen their understanding of Excel concepts.
The questions cover a range of topics, from foundational queries to more advanced techniques, highlighting practical 
applications
and best practices in database management and analysis.

Feel free to explore, learn, and reach out if you have any questions or would like to discuss these examples further.
Let's grow together in mastering the art of data querying!
